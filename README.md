# Keycaps

DES keycaps - Choc remix of the originals found here > https://github.com/sporkus/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles?tab=readme-ov-file
Note - these are smaller CFX spaced keycaps (roughly 16.5mm square). They'll work with conventional Choc spacing but if you're used to the feel of the standard DES, they cup tighter.
