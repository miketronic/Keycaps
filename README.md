# Keycaps

### DES
Choc remix of the originals found here, full credit goes to Pseudoku.

Note - these are smaller CFX spaced keycaps (roughly 16.5mm square). They'll work with conventional Choc spacing but if you're used to the feel of the standard DES, these cup tighter.


### Tilted Spherical
Slight remix of the orignals found here.  The creator mentions LDSA and lowprokb.ca.  If they were remixed from LDSA, then full credit goes to Darryl from Lowprokb.ca.

Note - These are again, scaled down slightly to 16.5mm square. Added sprues for easier printing.
